## About the Class
#### AP Computer Science Principles
I took this course during my senior year at Ravenwood High School, and I created this project as my final project that I submitted for the AP exam at the end of the year. Throughout the year we learned the basics of Javascript and how to use it to create apps



Javascript project created in AP Computer Science Principles my senior year (2020-2021)

Note that some of the code (i think randomFood2) is redundant because I had to meet requirements for the AP exam but had it more concise before and had to change it.
