## 🌿 About the Class
#### AP Computer Science Principles
I took this course during my senior year at Ravenwood High School (2020-2021), and I created this project as my final project that I submitted for the AP exam at the end of the year. Throughout the year we learned the basics of Javascript and how to use it to create different kinds of simple apps.

## 🍏 About the Project
The assignment for this project was to create a game using Javascript that fit a specific rubric with required techniques we had to use. I honestly don't remember what was on the rubric, but I remember struggling for days figuring out how to fit one of the requirements because how I had made my code worked without it, so I had to make redundant code to fit the requirement. I promise I knew how to make it more concise, I just needed to change it to make sure I got full credit for the project. We were given two weeks of in-class time (47 minute periods) to work on this project and then were allowed to work on it outside of class up until the due date in the middle of May.

As for the code I included in this repository, it is the original code I wrote for the project. You can look at it and critique it in all its glory, but just so you know I kept it as it is to use as a comparison of where I started coding to where I am now.
